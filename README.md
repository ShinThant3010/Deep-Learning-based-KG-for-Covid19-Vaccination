# Deep-Learning-based-KG-Construction-for-Covid19-Vaccination

Master's Research work and NII Internship Research supervised by Dr. Chutiporn Anutariya and Prof. Frederic Andreas. This is an ongoing research. 

## Project Description:
The research is about construction of content-based knowledge graph using the up-to-date vaccine specific literatures from the CORD-19 dataset.

Methodology:
- Dataset Preparation: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to focus on vaccine specific information
- Named Entity Recognition: BERT
- Relation Extraction: Verb Phrase Extraction
- Relation Clustering: Synset Grouping
- Triple Construction: using extracted entities and relations
- Triple Completion (KG Embedding): Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
